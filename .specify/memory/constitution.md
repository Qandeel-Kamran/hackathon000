# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Safety-First Design
All Physical AI and humanoid systems must prioritize safety above all other considerations; implementations must include multiple safety layers, fail-safes, and emergency stop mechanisms; human safety is non-negotiable in all interactions and operations

### Human-Centered Intelligence
Physical AI systems must be designed to enhance human capabilities and work harmoniously with humans; interfaces and behaviors should be intuitive and predictable; systems must respect human autonomy and decision-making authority

### Embodied Learning and Adaptation
Physical AI systems must be capable of learning from real-world interactions and adapting to new situations; embodied cognition principles must guide the design of perception-action loops; continuous learning mechanisms should be built into all systems

### Ethical Control and Transparency
Humanoid robots must maintain transparent control mechanisms with clear human oversight; decision-making processes must be interpretable; ethical guidelines must be embedded at the system architecture level

### Interdisciplinary Integration
Physical AI development must integrate insights from neuroscience, biomechanics, cognitive science, and robotics; cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential for authentic embodied intelligence

### Real-World Validation
All Physical AI systems must be validated in real-world scenarios before deployment; simulation alone is insufficient for embodied systems; testing must include diverse environments and use cases

## Reader Assumptions and Prerequisites

Readers are expected to have intermediate-level knowledge in robotics, machine learning, and control systems; familiarity with kinematics, dynamics, and sensor fusion is required; mathematical background in linear algebra, calculus, and probability is essential; programming experience in Python, C++, or MATLAB is necessary

## Scope and Boundaries

Included: Embodied AI, humanoid locomotion, manipulation, perception, learning, human-robot interaction, biomechanics; Excluded: purely virtual AI systems, non-humanoid robots, industrial automation without human interaction, ethical discussions without technical implementation

## Governance
All implementations must follow established safety protocols; code and designs must undergo peer review for safety compliance; experimental validation is required before claiming any capabilities; continuous safety assessment is mandatory
